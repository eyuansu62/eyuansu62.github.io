## <i class="fa fa-paperclip"></i> Short Bio

**Bowen Qin** is a researcher at the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), specializing in the evaluation, alignment, and code intelligence of large language models (LLMs). At BAAI, he contributes to [FlagEval platform](https://flageval.baai.ac.cn/#/home), where he leads the design of its core subjective evaluation system, enhancing the accuracy and scalability of LLM evaluation.
He earned his master’s degree with top honors from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), under the guidance by [**Prof. Min Yang**](https://minyang.me/) at 2023. He was a research intern at Alibaba DAMO Academy mentored by [**Binyuan Hui**](https://huybery.github.io/), who is very insightful and patient mentor.
He is a member of the [BIRD team](https://huggingface.co/birdsql), which drives the development of text-to-SQL for read-world database applications.
Throughout his academic journey, he collaborated with many talent researchers, including: [Jinyang Li](https://jinyang-li.me/), [Duanyu Feng](https://colfeng.github.io/), [Binyuan Hui](https://huybery.github.io/) and [Yequan Wang](https://www.wangyequan.com/).
